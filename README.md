### Branches

- The `main` branch is, well, the main branch
- Do NOT commit directly to `main` unless the change is insignificant
- DO create a task branch to resolve a specific issue
- DO make a merge request for that branch to merge into main
    - If unsure about changes, request a reviewer
- DO when making a merge request, reference the issue it completes

### Issues

Issues will serve as tasks for us to distribute and complete.

- DO make issue an adequate size (not too big that it cannot be finished in like whole day)
- DO tag our "Group Project" project in the issue, so it gets added to the tracker
- DO add adequate information about the task/issue in the description AND title.
    - how to replicate, steps to take, what's currently happening, how it should be
- DO add a type to the issue
- DO set the proper milestone (stage) for the issue
- DO after creating the issue, add a status for it in the Group Project.
    - Typically the "Todo" status

To see the task board of all issues/tasks, navigate to Projects -> Group Project

- DO NOT assign more than one task to yourself at a time
    - unless there are multiple small ones you can complete at once
    - this is so that other people have more flexibility to choose tasks
- DO once you've assigned yourself a task, drag it into the "In Progress" column
